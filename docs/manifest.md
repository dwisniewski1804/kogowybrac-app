## Mission

Enable citizens to make informed electoral decisions by providing reliable, verified, and source-based data about candidates in the context of their electoral district.

---

## Principles

### 1. Facts over narrative
We do not interpret.
We do not evaluate.
We do not recommend.

We show data + source.

---

### 2. District context
Users see only candidates from their district.
No global rankings.

---

### 3. Provenance
Every piece of information has:
- source
- fetch date
- snapshot reference

---

### 4. Privacy minimalism
We store only:
- email
- selected district

No profiling.
No sensitive data.

---

### 5. Transparent methodology
If indicators or aggregations appear in the future, their calculation methodology will be public.

## What we are NOT

- We are not an opinion portal.
- We are not an electoral committee.
- We are not an agitation platform.
- We do not suggest who to vote for.

The decision belongs to the user.
